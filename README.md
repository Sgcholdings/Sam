# Sam

is a virtual assistant AI technology developed by Kudzanai, It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news. Sam can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Users are able to extend the Sam capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps such as weather programs and audio features).
